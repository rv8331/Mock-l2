1. Devops Workflow (Code to Deployment : Git -> Build service -> deployment -> Servers)
2. Offline Installation of packages using Yum
3. Explain AWS CICD implementation
4. Shell scripting scenarios ( bash scripts, awk, sed, for, if else)
Ans: # bash scripts := It is used to automate repetitive tasks on Linux filesystem
     
     # awk := It is use for filtering the the content from the file.

	eg: * To primt only the first column with delimiteras':'
		awk -f ":" '{print $1}'/etc/passwd (/etc/file is the path or file location from were we want the output)

	    * To print first 6 lines
		awk 'NR<6' /etc/passwd (/etc/file is the path or file location from were we want the output)
	
	    * To print lines from 5 to 10 
		awk 'NR==5,NR==10'/etc/passwd (/etc/file is the path or file location from were we want the output)

	    * To print range of lines
		awk -f ":"'NR>0 && NR<6 {print$1}' /etc/passwd (/etc/file is the path or file location from were we want the output)

     # Sed := To replace some comntain in shell script dynamically we use 'sed'

	eg: sed 's/:/./g' (previous file name) > (new file name) (in this is replace ':' by '.')

     # For loop:= A 'for loop' is a bash programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.
	eg:= #!/bin/sh

             for var in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
	     do
             	echo $var
             done

            Upon execution, you will receive the following result − 0
								    1
								    2
								    3
								    4
								    5
								    6
								    7
								    8
								    9

Command Line Arguments: $1, $2, $3

*How to use command line arguments in a Script?
Ans: Command line arguments (also known as positional parameters) are the arguments specified at the command prompt with a command or script to be executed.
     "$1"= it represent postional parameter.
 Example: #!/bin/bash
	  echo "first number you have entered"$1
	  echo "second number you have entered"$2 	

*How to check if my previously executed command was successful?
Ans: By command :- "echo $?" and if output is '0' it is successful.

*What is Shell Redirection Operators?
Ans:- Each stream uses redirection commands. Single bracket '>' or double bracket '>>' can be used to redirect standard output.
      '>'= it replace the previous output with new output
      '>>' = it append the output (mean add another output)


    The bash shell has three standard streams in I/O redirection:

	*standard input (stdin) : The stdin stream is numbered as stdin (0). The bash shell takes input from stdin. By default, keyboard is used as input.
	*standard output (stdout) : The stdout stream is numbered as stdout (1). The bash shell sends output to stdout. Output goes to display.
	*standard error (stderr) : The stderr stream is numbered as stderr (2). The bash shell sends error message to stderr. Error message goes to display.


*What is crontab in Linux, how to set a cronjob?
Ans:- Crontab files can be used to automate backups, system maintenance and other repetitive tasks. 

	Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and looks like this:

# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── Days of the week range: 0 – 7. Starting from Monday, 0 or 7 represents Sunday;
# │ │ │ │ │                                   
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * * <command to execute>




*How to Debug a Shell Script? 
Ans:-bash -x script.sh

*How to find all the files modified in the last 5 days and save the result in a text file?
Ans:- ctime , mtime , atime for files

*I want to install a package and is failing, what are the troubleshooting steps that you will follow
Ans:- *Check Whether Required Installed Packages Are Available.
      *Check Whether the Packages You Want to Install Are Available.
      *Check Whether the Packages You Want to Install Are Installable in This Image.
      *Check which version of the pkg:/entire incorporation package is installed.

*which port curl command connects, and on which port u get the response

*How to kill process, telnet, check load on server, netstat, nmap, nc commands
Ans:- * To kill process in Linux with PID: kill -9 pid.
      * In Linux, the telnet command is used to create a remote connection with a system over a TCP/IP network.
      * By "Uptime" command check load on server.
      * #netstat -r     = Display routing table
        # netstat -ie   = The equivalent to default ifconfig command to list all active network interfaces
        # netstat -antc	= Continuously monitor all TCP connection. use -u for UDP.
        # netstat -ltp	= Display all open TCP ports along with PID and program. 
      * Nmap is Linux command-line tool for network exploration and security auditing	
      * nc command = On Unix-like operating systems, the nc command runs Netcat, a utility for sending raw data over a network connection.



*What all things ssh needs for authentication
Ans:- To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local computer.

DevOps
▪ What is Inventory and where the inventory file?
Ans:- The Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate.
       The default location for the inventory file is " /etc/ansible/hosts ".

▪ What is Ansible Role?
Ans:- Ansible roles allow you to develop reusable automation components by grouping and encapsulating related automation artifacts,
      like configuration files, templates, tasks, and handlers. Because roles isolate these components,it's easier to reuse them and share them with other people.

▪ What is Module?
Ans:- A module is a reusable, standalone script that Ansible runs on your behalf, either locally or remotely. 
      Modules interact with your local machine, an API, 
      or a remote system to perform specific tasks like changing a database password or spinning up a cloud instance.


 
▪ How to define inventory in Ansible

▪ parameters in ansible.cfg
Ans:- we provide permission for inventory file by uncommenting the '#' function from "inventory= /etc/ansible/hosts" and "sudo-user=root"

▪ Ansible configuration file precedence.
Ans:- Installation of Ansible provides us a default /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg configuration file,in
      which we can make various settings like the default user with which playbook should run on he remote server and the privilege mode of that user.
▪ Ansible variable precedence

▪ CICD Pipeline?
Ans:- A CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software.
      A CI/CD pipeline introduces monitoring and automation to improve the process of application development, 
      particularly at the integration and testing phases, as well as during delivery and deployment.

▪ Dockerfile?
Ans:- A Dockerfile is a file used to build a Docker image to your specifics.With a Dockerfile constructed, 
      you could then easily build the same image over and over,without having to walk through the process manually.

▪ Can we use two from in Dockerfile?
Ans:- With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile.

▪ Diff between ADD and COPY commmand?
Ans:- COPY copies a file/directory from your host to your image.
      ADD copies a file/directory from your host to your image, but can also fetch remote URLs, extract TAR files, etc...
      Use COPY for simply copying files and/or directories into the build context.
      Use ADD for downloading remote resources, extracting TAR files, etc..



 
      
▪ Diff between CMD and entrypoint command?
Ans:- CMD sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.
      ENTRYPOINT command and parameters will not be overwritten from command line. Instead, all command line arguments will be added after ENTRYPOINT parameters.


▪ Write the shellscript for count of IP Address from file?
	- nginx , httpd => /var/log/nginx/access.log 
						/var/log/nginx/error.log

▪ List of open ports?
Ans;- Enter the command. netstat -a. Press Enter on the keyboard. The list of open ports will be displayed.

▪ What does nslookup and netstat?
Ans;- The nslookup := command queries internet domain name servers in two modes. 
      Interactive mode allows you to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains, or to print a list of the hosts in a domain. 
      In noninteractive mode, the names and requested information are printed for a specified host or domain.
 
     
      The network statistics ( netstat ) command is a networking tool used for troubleshooting and configuration, 
      that can also serve as a monitoring tool for connections over the network. 
      Both incoming and outgoing connections, routing tables, port listening, and usage statistics are common uses for this command.


 ▪ What is process? How to kill process? How to get PID?
▪ Whta is the use of du command?
Ans;- is used to estimate file space usage
  

▪ Modules? Ansible playbook


▪ I want to monitor OS metrics and performance counters of my amazon linux instance. 
Ans:- By using cloudwatch metrics.

▪ How to configure custom cloudwatch metrics.

▪ How to access EC2 instance, if pem file is lost?
Ans:- Accessing the EC2 instance even if you loose the pem file is rather easy.

     1.First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.

     2.Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.

     3.Go to EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.

     4.Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).

     5.Login to your helper instance with its pem file.

     6.Execute below commands:

        # mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
        # cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/root/.ssh/
        # umount /mnt
     7.Detach the secondary volume from helper instance.

     8.Again attach the volume back to our recovery instance. Start the instance. Terminate the helper instance.


Python script using Boto3
1)Write python script for send an email notification When a specific Instance(s) stops in the production environment
2)Write Python script to find unused volume and send an email notification
3)Write python script to find unused EIPs

How to automatically tag EC2 instance after its launched and if its not tagged?  
(Ans:  create cloudwatch event pattern using API Call via CloudTrail and trigger lambda function, 
write python code for creating tag in the lambda function)

Logging:
VPC Flow Logs -> S3
CloudTrail Logs -> S3
ELB Logs -> S3

Query above logs : Athena

what types of error codes find if you enable ELB LOGS, What is meaning of what error code, 
What is 2xx ? What is 3xx? what is 4xx? What is 5xx?
